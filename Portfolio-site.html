    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <div>Hello! My name is Andy Schachter. Currently I am a Senior Trust Reporting Analyst for US Bank on the CDO Team. We run compliance and analytics reporting as trustee for our clients, who are issuers of CLOs (Collateralized Loan Obligations). If you've read/watched The Big Short, it somewhat involves what I work on</div>
    <br>
    <div>I'm also currently a candidate for a Web Development Certificate in the Stack Education Winter 2021 cohort. I'm looking forward to learning more about full stack development and how it will affect potential career opportunities</div>
    <br>
    <div>Outside of work, I love to play sports and be outside as much as possible. I also enjoy reading and cooking, though not the cleaning up after.</div>
